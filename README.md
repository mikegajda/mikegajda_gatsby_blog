# Using Wordpress

https://using-wordpress.gatsbyjs.org/

Example site that demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites that pull data from the
[WordPress CMS API](https://www.wordpress.com/).

IMPORTANT NOTE: This example site won't keep working if you switch the WordPress site to one of yours. It's meant as a learning resource. Try starting from scratch with a site created by `gatsby new` and start copying over parts from this site starting with `gatsby-config.js`.
